# 4290 Programming Training Ch 2.2 - Commands & Subsystems
## Commands
One of the most common design patterns for programming robots in WPILib is called "Command Based" programming. This way of writing robot code allows for commands to be scheduled based on conditions, which allows for a cleaner more understandable codebase.

Before we can go into commands into full depth, it is important to understand the concept of treating functions as data. Below are some article(s) to explain this:
- [1. Article - Treating Functions as Data (WPILib)](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/basic-programming/functions-as-data.html#method-references)
- [2. Article - Lambda Expressions in Java (Geeks for Geeks)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/lambda-expressions-java-8/)
