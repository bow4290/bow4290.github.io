# 4290 Programming Training Ch 1.6 - Object Oriented Basics
## Object Oriented Programming Overview
Object oriented programming is a popular programming paradigm which features classes, objects, inheritance, abstraction and more. The following article(s) go over these concepts:
- [1. Video - Object Oriented Concepts (Simply Coding)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A38y7OO8OK4)
- [2. Article - Java OOP (W3 Schools)](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_oop.asp)

## Classes & Objects

## Packages
In Java, packages are used to group together multiple different classes, interfaces, and more. In WPILib, we would use this to group all of our robot code together, but packages are used in most Java codebases. The following article(s) will explain this further:
- [1. Java Packages / API (W3 Schools)](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_packages.asp)
- [2. Java Modifiers (W3 Schools)](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_modifiers.asp)

### Naming Packages
Despite how they are shown in the previous articles, most codebases follow a more strict naming pattern for packages, which is usually the official Java package naming [(found here)](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/package/namingpkgs.html), however FRC uses a slightly different naming pattern, which will be generated by default when creating a robot codebase.
