# 4290 Programming Training - Chapter 2
## About FRC Programming
This chapter will be going over interacting robots using WPILib and Java, which will go over things such as Commands, Subsystems, Interacting with Hardware, and more. The most useful resource for FRC programming is the official [WPILib docs](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/index.html), as well as the language specific API documentation, which can be found here: 
- [API docs for Java](https://github.wpilib.org/allwpilib/docs/release/java/index.html)
- [API docs for C++](https://github.wpilib.org/allwpilib/docs/release/cpp/index.html)
