# 4290 Programming Training - Chapter 1.1
## Syntax
The syntax of a programming defines how code written in it will be structured, providing many rules and guides for best practices. The following article(s)explain some of these rules and guides for Java.

- [1. Article - Syntax (Geeks for Geeks)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/java-basic-syntax/?ref=lbp)
- [2. Video - Java in 100 Seconds (Fireship)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9AzO1FMgM8)
  - Although this video is a good for starting, I would recommend watching this after reading through the 1st article
  - The intent of this video is to show off some of the basics of Java in a visual way. It's completely fine if you don't understand some of the things talked about in the video!



## Variables
Variables are like containers for values in code. Variables can have many different types and values, such as numbers or words. The following article(s) explain how these work in Java.
