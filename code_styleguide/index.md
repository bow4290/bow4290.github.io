# 4290 Code Style Guide
These guides should serve as a general definition on how code should be written and formatted. 'Style' can encompass anything from naming conventions to how to structure code.

## Updating Style Guides
These guides should be reviewed each year at the start of the season to ensure that the guides are up-to-date with the latest WPILib guidelines and recommendations, as those are important for general code maintenance. This *does not* mean that style guides have to or should be updated each year, and changes should not be made frequently.
