# 4290 Programming Training Ch 1.7 - Git & GitHub
## Basics of Git & GitHub
Since a full 2-part article has been made on the basics of using Git on this website, I recommend following [that article here](/guides/git_part_1.md).

## Documentation
The official documentation is also a good place to get information about Git, the same goes for GitHubs documentation. These, as well as other helpful tools can be found below:
- [Git Documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs)
- [GitHub Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en)
- [Git Book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2)
- [Git Visual Cheatsheet](https://ndpsoftware.com/git-cheatsheet.html#loc=index;)
