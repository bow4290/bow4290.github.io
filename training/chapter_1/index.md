This chapter of the book will be going over various basic topics on programming using Java, which is one of the programming languages that WPILib supports.

WPILib is the official library for FRC. In programming, a library is a bunch of reusable code made to make developing certain things easier, in this case, programming robots.

## Installing WPILib
The official first documentation has a great guide on installing WPILib that can be found [here](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/zero-to-robot/step-2/wpilib-setup.html).
